The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

Information about fuel use is included in this dataset. Several modes and types of cars have been put through testing to determine their effectiveness, consuption, and contamination.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

This data set contains data on births in the state of California. It's also broken down into three categories: typical-age mothers, teen mothers, and older mothers. You can also learn more about these organizations in any of California's counties. For this data set, information was accessible from 2008 to 2016.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 03

This data set contains lyrics from the Billboard Top 100 and analyzes each work's performance, yielding interesting results such as "watch" being the most common word in the top 15, followed by "love" and "I'm."

**Sample data visualization:**

### Moving Forward

I felt a range of emotions during the first week of this course, including worry and exhilaration. I've had the chance to improve my understanding of data visualization through the topics we discuss each week. I'm now trying to put what I just learnt into practice and keep myself informed of fresh information.
